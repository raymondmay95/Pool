# Pool
A react web3 application designed to take in a ceiling price, and distribute it's worth across crypto that task can be valued against.

## Target audiences
We are targeting families with children between the ages of 10 - 16 where all members posses access to the web.

## Concept
A team owner "--think of this user as a parent" will deposit either once or on a schedule funds to supply the application with funds to distibute.
The team owner will at this time set the initial amount of internal coins that will be minted.
